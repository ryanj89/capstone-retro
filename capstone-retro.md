# Capstone Retro

## Start
- Writing more detailed user stories instead of broad encompassing ones.
- Get more user testing on 'completed' features to iron out bugs.
- Deploy more often.

## Stop
- Don't keep banging my head against a problem if I get stuck instead of moving on or taking a break.
- Being overconfident about the overall scope of my project. Be realistic for the overall timeline.
- Committing everything to one branch or master.

## Continue
- Doing mockups/sketches of each component/page before doing any coding.
- Using Angular 4! It's awesome.
